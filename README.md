# Smart-Fire-Alarm-App

This is a project for my Engineering Design Class and is still in progress.

Basically it will connect to a fire alarm system that is tailored towards the hearing impaired person. It will connect to the smoke detector and other sensors to get real time data. Also, it will be connected to lights, speakers, and vibration pads and will allow the user to turn them off. 

The app is just a concept so the profile section is just really for looks. You can change your name, profile picture, and pronouns but nothing is actually saved in the backend. This also goes for connecthing the device it is just for looks.
